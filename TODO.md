- two build types, SPA and Node.

  - SPA version requires JS and logging in, but can be hosted for free (literally)

    - The end goal of SPA version is just to be yet another client app

  - Node version will work JSless for logged off users, but needs a server to run on.

    - The end goal of the Node version is to be a complete replacement to lemmy-ui

    - Authorized requests WILL require JS anyway, as I do _not_ want to deal with
      the security implications of having serverside access to user tokens

- Image gallery mode
- Better inter-community linking (automatic search?)
- Better accessibility if possible (I need to learn about accessbility best practices)
- Misc low hanging fruit
- Prettier UI (imo)
- Better embeds
- Filter out keywords
